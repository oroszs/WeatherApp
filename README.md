This is a practice weather application project I created which utilizes several api's to display weather forecast information.
The user may view the weather for their approximate location based on their ip address, or opt in to provide the app their coordinates for more precise information.
There is a search bar to find weather info for other locations, and a side nav bar which displays recently searched locations.
The user may "favorite" a location, and a list of these locations will be stored in local storage for future ease of use.
My focus was to gain experience with external api calls, asynchronous functions, JQuery, and built-in api functionality such as the geolocation and local storage api's.
