This is a weather application I created to practice interacting with APIs. It utilizes the OpenWeather, IPInfo.io, and Geolocation APIs to display accurate weather information.

The user may click the "Use Precise Location" button to opt in to allow the site permission to the user's coordinates for more accurate results.

The user may also search for other locations, and save them in local storage by clicking the heart icons next to previously searched locations.
